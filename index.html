              <p>I include my other school courses because i think it is somehow related to the Friday project objectives. I think discrete mathematics improves my analytical thinking and algorithm as well. Currently, we are now on week5 discussing about equivalence relationship(symmetric, transivity and reflexive properties). I usually accomplish this on my weekends but to make my time more valuable today, I decided to accomplish reading the lessons today. It also have an assignment requirement that i scheduled doing on Saturday.</p>

              <p>In addition to my discrete math, i am aslo taking up linux course. We are now on week5 and our topic for this week is history of bash, csh, ksh and identify their differences and its own advantages. Like discrete math, i also have an assignment requirement which i have to accomplished before sunday.</p>
